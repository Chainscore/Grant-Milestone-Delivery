# General Notes

I'm willing to pass it since the deliverable requirements were technically met. Docker-compose now works to spin up the relayer.

## Tests

~~The test is failing with errors but it's due to the .env setup.~~

~~After copying the example .env file the tests are currently failing with a lot of errors:~~

A worker process has failed to exit gracefully and has been force exited. This is likely caused by tests leaking due to improper teardown. Try running with --detectOpenHandles to find leaks. Active timers can also cause this, ensure that .unref() was called on them.
