Secondly: Missing both paseo & kusama relay & asset hub chains, as well as most parachains. Thirdly: Only three xcm test queries in [integration test suite](https://github.com/openguild-labs/polkadot-agent-kit/tree/d80885c1036731424f2a18807223174ccbea9544/packages/sdk/tests/integration-tests/sdk.itest.ts); these should at least be supplemented by equivalent tests for other parachain/relaychain pairings. |
