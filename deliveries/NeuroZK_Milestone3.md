Application Document: https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/NeuroZK.md
Milestone Number: 3

Context

NeuroZK Implementation
The NeuroZK implementation to verify the integrity of AI models executed in third party servers, using a SNARK based ZKML verification system on a substrate blockchain.


#### **Deliverables:**

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | GPLv3 |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how users can (for example) deploy apps using yaml files through our interface |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| **0e.** | Article | We will publish a medium blog explaining the vision of NueroZK, current features and future plans |
| 1. | Testing suite | We will provide a testing facility to examine the working of ZK verification tool with the Cyborg parachain.|
| 2. | Substrate Module: ZK verifier | This pallet will be responsible for verifying and confirming proofs emitted by the offchain ZK worker through the cyborg oracle. |
| 3. | Cyborg ZK worker | A feature to the Cyborg worker node to posses specific instructions about ZK proof generation for a specific executed AI algorithm|
| 4. | Substrate module: Worker Rewards | A custom pallet that holds the logic of assigning rewards to commited worker nodes for executing user tasks |
